    <h3>2-1 Semester:</h3>
    <p>Collaboration on a project to develop a Resume Generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.</p>
    <p>During the 2-1 Semester, I collaborated with my friend on a project to develop a Resume Generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project helped me solidify my frontend development skills and provided hands-on experience in building user-friendly web applications.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I started learning about version control using Git and GitHub. Understanding the basics of version control was crucial for effective collaboration and project management.</p>
    <p>I also set up a dual-boot system with Ubuntu and Windows on my computer, primarily using Ubuntu for development purposes. This allowed me to explore different operating systems and gain proficiency in Linux-based environments.</p>

    <h2>2-2 Semester:</h2>
    <p>In the 2-2 Semester, I continued to enhance my frontend development skills while exploring web deployment tools like Netlify. Deploying projects using Netlify provided me with practical knowledge of hosting websites and managing web applications.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I delved into learning Flask with Python. Flask is a lightweight web framework that allowed me to build dynamic web applications with ease. I dedicated time each day to learn and practice Flask, gradually expanding my knowledge and proficiency in backend development.</p>
    <p>During this semester, I completed courses on HTML/CSS and JavaScript from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. These courses deepened my understanding of web development fundamentals and provided valuable insights into best practices.</p>

    <h2>3-1 Semester:</h2>
    <p>In the 3-1 Semester, I explored PHP and MySQL as part of my journey in web development. Understanding server-side scripting with PHP and database management with MySQL was essential for building dynamic web applications.</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges of balancing coursework and other commitments, I resumed learning Flask on Hyperskill, an online learning platform. Consistency in learning and practice allowed me to reinforce my knowledge and skills in Flask development.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I discovered Canva software for graphic design during a college event named Hackathon. Utilizing Canva, I contributed to designing brochures, posters, banners, logos, and certificates for the event, enhancing my design skills.</p>

    <h2>3-2 Semester:</h2>
    <p>The 3-2 Semester was marked by significant projects and learning experiences. I developed the JVD Payment Storing Site for my college, showcasing my proficiency in frontend and backend development. This project involved designing and implementing a comprehensive college administration system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I created the Results Portal for the college, focusing on user-centric design and intuitive interfaces. This project required collaboration with faculty and staff to ensure seamless access to student results and information.</p>
    <p>Throughout the semester, I continued my learning journey by exploring advanced topics in Git and GitHub, as well as basics of Jira and Trello for project management. Furthermore, I enrolled in courses on Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift on Coursera to deepen my knowledge of containerization and orchestration technologies.</p>
    <p>Finally, I deployed the Results Portal online, enabling students to access their results conveniently. This deployment process provided hands-on experience with web hosting services, dynamic page uploads, and SSL certificate management.</p>
